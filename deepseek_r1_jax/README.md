# Minimal Deepseek R1 inference

**tl;dr: open-source Deepseek R1 inference using JAX, minimal yet performant**

<br/>

This is a pure JAX implementation of Deepseek V3 inference, including a
checkpoint converter for the R1 weights. It currently runs on TPU. Support for
GPU is in-progress.

The entire model is defined in [model.py](deepseek_r1_jax/model.py) and invoked
via [main.py](main.py). Among other things, the model code demonstrates:
* an MLA attention implementation;
* expert and tensor-parallelism via JAX's
  [`shard_map`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/sharded-computation.html#manual-parallelism-with-shard-map)
  for easy multi-device/multi-host computation; and
* simple int8 quantization.

This example aims to be a concise, self-contained, fully open-source codebase,
with performance that is reasonably comparable to other R1 inference offerings (at
cost). We hope that it is easy to understand and offers an accessible starting
point for performant inference with JAX. See the
[performance rundown](#inference-performance-results) below.

In addition, this repo includes an
[overview](#transformer-parallelism-strategies) of how to shard transformers and
a [discussion](#optimizing-deepseek-v3) of the specific optimizations used in
this implementation, as well as a [workflow](#working-with-multi-host-clusters)
for interactive development on multi-host GPU and TPU clusters using
ipyparallel.

## Quickstart

Due to the large model size (671B parameters), a multi-host platform is required to run
the full model. We've tested on v5e-64.

Run on all hosts in the TPU cluster:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
e.g. for Cloud TPU:
```
$ gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh {TPU_NAME} --worker=all \
    --command="cd ~/deepseek-r1-jax && python3 main.py"
```

```

### Optimization Decisions

Deepseek is a unique model in that it (i) uses a unique form of attention,
Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and (ii) uses an MoE layer with a large number of
small experts. This presents some challenges in optimizing the model for
TPUs and GPUs to maximize either compute (in training) or memory-bandwidth use
in inference.

#### Accelerator Agnostic Optimization

- Q: What parameter influences inference speed the most?

  A: HBM bandwidth

- Q: Fully-replicated or sharded activations?

  A: For low-latency decoding, fully-replicated activations are usually faster
  since that strategy relies on a all-reduce communication instead of repeated
  reduce-scatters. Computation (weights shards) is still partitioned, but local
  shared memory is traded for lower-latency communication.

- Q: Why doesn't this match the cost and performance of proprietary inference APIs?

  A: This example aims to balance simplicity with performance, and thus does not
  implement every possible optimization if they would add considerable complexity
  (e.g. heavy use of custom kernels). In addition, this example only uses
  well-known optimization strategies, and does not aim to introduce any new or
  closed-source techniques that inference providers may have independently developed.



#### TPU Optimizations

- Q: How to efficiently compute MLA attention on TPUs (which has 128 aligned-registers) for embeddings `nope` (d=128) vs `pe` embedding (d=64)

  A: Instead of concatenating the embeddings, we compute the inner product `qk`,`qk_nope` and `qk_pe`, separately summing them.

- Q: Inference or training TPUs (e.g., v5e or v5p)?

  A: Inference (v5e) since the matmul units are not as powerful, but can be lower latency at low utilization.

- Q: How to work with multiple hosts?

  A: (1) Launching the same python script via `python3 script.py` or (2) our `ipyparallel` setup.

- Q: Which TPU image to use?

  A: For v5e: `v2-alpha-tpuv5-lite`, for v6e: `v2-alpha-tpuv6e`. See [runtimes](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/runtimes).

#### Custom Kernels

1. [ragged dot](deepseek_r1_jax/decode_ragged_dot.py) - a grouped matmul operation

    *Needed for good decode inference performance with small batches.*

    XLA underlying JAX is very good at merging and fusing operations which means
    we often don't need custom kernels for optimal hardware performance.
    However, Deepseek R1 uses uncommonly many, but small experts.

    For anything but small batch sizes in decode, we can use
    [jax.lax.ragged_dot](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/5179642eb5572b8fbec01dca5e03e2a636e513c2/jax/_src/lax/lax.py#L2209)
    for full performance, but where `jax.lax.ragged_dot` is suboptimal, we write
    a custom TPU kernel which more aggressively prefetches the right-hand side
    into [TPU's VMEM](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/tpu/details.html).

## Transformer parallelism strategies

This section overviews different sharding strategies and their performance considerations for Transformer architectures in general.
For a very in-depth guide on this topic, check out [How to Scale Your Model](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/).
The next section goes over Deepseek-specific optimizations.

A typical decoder-only transformer consists of

1. An input embedding
    - a single weight $V \times D$
2. Repeated Decoder Layers (Attention + a Feed-forward layer)
    * Attention Layer
        - project input $BSD$ to $BSNH$ for queries, $BSNH$ for keys and $BSNH$ values, typically $D \approx N \cdot H$
        - compute the attention operation on $BSNH$, $BSNH$, $BSNH$ giving $BSNH$
        - project the output $BSNH$ back to $BSD$ using a projection matrix
    * Feed-forward Layer - a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) or a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
        - always (i) up-projection -> (ii) nonlinearity -> (iii) down-projection
        - MLP
            - up-projection: $BSD \times DF \rightarrow BSF$
            - down-projection: $BSF \times DF \rightarrow BSD$
        - MoE
            - each token in $BS$ can be routed to a matrix slice $EDF[\text{idx}, :, :]$
            - up-projection: $BSD \times EDF \rightarrow BSF$
            - down-projection: $BSF \times EDF \rightarrow BSD$
3. An output projection
    - a single weight $D \times V$

### Sharding strategies for a transformer

The simplest sharding strategy, naive eager pipeline parallelism, is putting the
first couple of layers on the first device, the next couple of layers on the
second, and so on, and it requires simple communication of passing activations
between devices every couple of layers. Unfortunately, for fast inference, this
implies that latter devices wait for the earlier ones to complete - decoding at
a speed of a single device. Strategies that favor parallel work among devices,
tensor-parallelism and fully-sharded data-parallel, are a better fit. We find
tensor-parallelism results in fastest inference.

The key to designing a sharding strategy is minimizing communication overhead.
There are typically several alternatives and the compiler will overlap
communication with computation as much as possible. Given this, it's usually
worth trying several alternatives and picking the one minimizing the total
runtime. The best strategy depends on the hardware configuration. The following
are general rules of thumb in different contexts

For low latency with 1D/2D sharding, the primary sharded matrix multiplication strategies are:
  - $BD_x \times D_xF \underset{\text{scatter}}{\longrightarrow} B F_x$ -
  contracting dimension with scatter (1 unit of comms)
  - $BD \times DF_x \underset{}{\longrightarrow} B F_x$ - replicated activations (no comms)
  - $BD_x \times D_xF \underset{\text{all-reduce}}{\longrightarrow} B F$ -
    contracting dimension with reduce comms after (2 units of comms)

- for attention activations should be sharded over heads (effectively the feature dimension)
- do not all-gather weights (no FSDP)

#### FSDP vs tensor-parallelism trade-off

Total FSDP comms is:

$$ 4 \times \text{cost}(\text{all-gather}) = 2 DH + 2 DF \approx 4 D^2 $$

Total tensor-parallelism comms is:

$$ 4 \times \text{cost}(\text{scatter}) = 2 \times \text{cost}(\text{all-reduce}) = 2 B H + 2 B F \approx 4 * B D $$

This, very roughly implies the trade-off (in favor of FDSP):

$$ \mathcal{O} \left( D^2 \right ) \leq \mathcal{O}\left(B D \right) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}\left(D\right) \leq \mathcal{O}\left(B\right) $$

FSDP can be more efficient if the the batch size is on the order of the model dimension. For fast latency Llama 3.1 70B

$$
B = 16 ~~~ D = 8192
$$

strongly implying a preference for tensor-parallelism (in the context of low-latency decoding).

## Optimizing Deepseek V3

### MLA Attention

The attention layer computes the equivalent of $x_q = x W_q$, $x_{k,v} = x W_{k,q}$ via

$$
x_{q,k,v} = \text{rms-norm}\left( x W_{A_{q,k,v}}\right) W_{B_{q,k,v}}
$$

In our low-latency setting, we have fully-replicated activations and need
outputs sharded over attention heads.

In regular attention we don't have to communicate because $x W_{q,k,v}$ is
$BD \overset{DQ_xH}{\rightarrow} BQ_xH$, (i.e., the weight sharding implies
output sharding), but in MLA we have two matmuls potentially requiring
communication which adds to latency. To side-step this problem, we **fully
replicated either matrix.** Since the rms-norm operates on the full tensor axis,
it's often easier to replicate $W_{A_{q,k,v}}$ since that results in the
intermediate $x W_{A_{q,k,v}}$ being fully replicated as well.

### MLP Layers (and shared expert) in Inference

The MLP in both the first 3 layers of the network (Deepseek R1 uses 3 standard
MLPs followed by 58 MoE layers) is a fairly standard Llama-like operation

$$
\left(\text{silu}(x W_\text{gate}) \cdot (x W_\text{up}) \right) W_\text{down}
$$

so we have to choose a two-step matrix multiplication sharding strategy
($W_\text{gate}$ or $W_\text{up}$ then $W_\text{down}$). For low-latency
settings pure tensor-parallelism works well

$$
B D \overset{DF_{\color{red}x}}\rightarrow B F_{\color{red}x} \overset{F_{\color{red}x}D}{\rightarrow} {\color{red}{AR}} \rightarrow BD
$$

### MoE Layer in Inference

*The MoE layer implementation:* In most MoE layers each token in a batch and
sequence is computed independently. Typically the first step in an MoE
implementation consists of flattening the sequences in a batch into a single
flat list of tokens. These tokens are then routed to potentially multiple
experts and finally reduced (if each token is routed to multiple experts) —
typically via a weighted sum. Each expert consists of a two stage MLP with a
gate projection, up projection followed by down projection layer.

$$
z_i = \text{silu}(x_i W_\text{gate}) \cdot (x_i W_\text{up}) \cdot W_\text{down}
$$

While multiple implementations are possible, our MoE implementation relies on
the **ragged dot** subroutine defined as multiplying a ragged (packed) 2D
left-hand side and a dense 3D stack of 2D matrices on the right hand side with a
list of sequence lengths in the packed left-hand side representation.

$$
\left( x \in \mathbb{R}^{\left(\sum_i g_i\right) \times k} \right) \cdot \left( A \in \mathbb{R}^{e \times k \times n} \right) = y \in \mathbb{R}^{\left(\sum_i g_i\right) \times n} ~~~ \text{where} ~~~ g \in \mathbb{N}^e
$$

For example, $g_0 = 3$ implies that the first 3 rows of $x$ should be multiplied
by the first matrix in the stack $A[0, :, :]$ and placed in the first 3 rows of
$y$. Next, if $g_1 = 5$ the next 5 rows of $x_i$ should be multiplied by $A[1,
:, :]$ and placed in the next 5 rows of $y$, i.e., $y[3:8, :]$.

Relying on ragged dot requires sorting the tokens after routing because ragged
dot expects packed contiguous groups of tokens. This leads to our implementation:

1. route tokens to experts
2. sort tokens into contiguous expert groups
3. apply ragged dot to gate, up projection
4. apply ragged dot to down projection
5. inverse sort tokens back to the original order
6. reduce tokens across the n experts each token was routed to via a weighted sum

The sharding strategy of this MoE implementation then looks as follows

1. route tokens to experts
    - if in prefill, shard tokens along the batch/sequence to avoid duplicating routing work
2. shard expert dimensions, devices lack experts for some tokens, simply fill the outputs with zeros
    - place the tokens for which experts are missing on this device at the end of the sorted list
    - if dropless, maintain the full token list
    - if dropping, truncate the token list at a static length (tokens without experts are last and so are dropped), e.g. 2 $\times$ batch size multiplied by the fraction of experts a single device holds
3. apply ragged dot to gate, up projection
    - the ragged dot operator already supports sparsity, so we rely on it not computing tokens not assigned to any experts (on this device)
4. apply ragged dot to down projection
    - the ragged dot operator already supports sparsity, so we rely on it not computing tokens not assigned to any experts (on this device)
- if dropless

  5. if dropless inverse sort the tokens, zeros are already present in the tokens for which this device is missing experts

  6. reduce tokens across the n experts each token was routed to via a weighted sum
      - tokens for which experts are missing are equal to zero so the reduction yields correct results

- if dropping

  5. prepare a buffer equal to the size of the full token list and scatter-add tokens for which this device has experts into the buffer
      - this combines the inverse token sort with weighted reduction of tokens across n experts

The output then needs to be communicated across expert shards. Standard tensor
parallelism is fully compatible with this implementation because it can be
applied across columns or rows of the stacked matrices in the ragged dot
operation.

In the specific case of Deepseek V3/R1 MoE, since the expert layers are small,
$E_{=256}D_{=7168}F_{=2048}$ and TPUs work best when the minor-most dimensions
is $\geq 128$, we can only shard the expert matrices among $16$ devices mesh
axis ($16 \cdot 128 = 2048$). For the other axis in the mesh the only other
shardable dimension is the expert dimension.

For an all-reduce matmul sharding strategy we end up with the following sharding:

$$
B D \overset{E_{\color{red}y} DF_{\color{red}z}}\rightarrow B F_{\color{red}z} \overset{E_{\color{red}y}F_{\color{red}z}D}{\rightarrow} {\color{red}{AR}_z} \rightarrow {\color{red}{AR}_y} \rightarrow BD
$$
